# Session log (fork-rust)

Newest first. One entry per working session: what was done, numbers, what is next.

## 2026-10-16 — M3 done

- `cc-drawing` (L1): the display model (spaces → batches per layer × colour × weight: polylines, fills, texts),
  serialising to the JS `compileDrawing` shape. `cc-io-dwg::compile` + `dxf_model`: BimCraft's compile step and DXF
  reader ported at parity (0 differences: 78 corpus DWGs, 19 client DWGs, 106 DXFs). Agent-ported, merged in M3.2.
- `cc-render` (L3): wgpu, instanced anti-aliased line quads + lyon-tessellated fills, positions f32 relative to each
  space's origin and the view centre subtracted in f64 (survey coordinates stay steady), one uniform slot per view
  (model, or sheet + each viewport), one draw call per visible batch.
- `cc-ui-egui` (L6): canvas through an `egui_wgpu` paint callback, sheets (paper, viewports clipped/scaled/twisted
  like dwg-view.js, viewport frames), texts on top (egui text, culled, budgeted), layers panel, sheet tabs, status bar,
  `UI_COMMANDS` + `UiApp::run`, injected `Services` (pickers, inbox, xref lookup), Dark/Light tokens with a contrast
  test, bundled OFL fonts (egui's default fonts carry the Ubuntu Font Licence: not on our list).
- Apps: desktop `cadcraft` (eframe + rfd), web `cadcraft-web` (WebGPU only; a clear message without it; panic →
  message on the page), `cadcraft-shot` (headless screenshots + frame bench through egui_kittest on wgpu/lavapipe).
  `cargo xtask web` builds with trunk and moves the inline init script into a hashed file (CSP: no inline script).
- Deployed through `forks/deploy.sh rust dist/web` → https://rust.getcadcraft.com (`?sample`, `?bench`).
- Numbers in ROADMAP.md. Honest gap: the browser build is only 1.2–1.5× the JS reader (native 2.6–4.2×).
- Dev tools outside the repo: `forks/tools/cdiff.mjs` (compile parity), `forks/tools/webshot.mjs` (Chromium +
  SwiftShader WebGPU screenshots: needs `--use-vulkan=swiftshader --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader`).

## 2026-10-16 — M2 done

- **cc-dwg in Rust** (`crates/io-dwg`): a line-by-line port of CadCraft's own `lib/dwg` reader (≈6,500 lines of JS →
  ≈12,900 lines of Rust incl. tests): R13–R2018 containers (R2004 LZ, R2007 Reed-Solomon + R21 LZ), bit reader, header variables,
  classes, object map, every object decoder (entities, tables, objects, ACAD_TABLE family, ACIS solids + data storage,
  surfaces, multileaders, dynamic blocks), and the model assembly of `read.js`.
- **Design:** the reader builds the JS model itself as a dynamic `value::Obj` (insertion-ordered, `&'static` keys), so
  `parity dwg` emits the same JSON as `readDwg` and the kit diffs the *whole* model, not a summary. Objects decode in
  parallel (rayon) and entities convert in parallel; R2004 pages decompress in parallel. Every decoder runs under the
  crate's deny list (no unwrap/panic/indexing/unchecked arithmetic/lossy casts); a panic in one object would cost that
  object only (`catch_unwind` guard).
- **Parity:** `tools/fork-parity run.mjs --fork rust --engine dwg` → 78/78 match. Every other DWG in testfiles: 0 diffs.
- **Speed:** 2.6–4.2× the JS on the corpus; 3.0–3.4× on the large client drawings; single-threaded 1.8–2×
  (ROADMAP.md has the table). Allocation is the remaining cost (a dynamic model allocates per field); a faster allocator
  measured ~35% more, but the good ones are C (mimalloc) — not taken (AGENTS.md: no C unless unavoidable).
- **Safety:** fuzz target `dwg_read` (libFuzzer): 30 s in every `cargo xtask ci`, a 10-minute run at M2's end (see the
  M2 report); 500 mutated corpus files (truncations, bit flips, random bursts) through the CLI: no panic.
- **How it was built:** the lead ported the core and the table decoders; five agents ported entities, objects, tables,
  solids/surfaces and multileaders/dynamic blocks in parallel work copies, each to zero differences on its types, merged
  in M2.1–M2.4; M2.5 = speed.
- Next: M3, the 2D viewer (DWG/DXF, model + sheets, pan/zoom, layers) on desktop and web (WebGPU), deployed to
  rust.getcadcraft.com.

## 2026-10-15

- M1: workspace skeleton (crates by layer, apps, xtask, fuzz), lints, configs, CI workflow. `cargo xtask ci` green.
